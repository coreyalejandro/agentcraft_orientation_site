# SST Declaration Template

My Single Source of Truth (

- **Title:** _Name of your chosen primary reference (e.g., Anthropic Agent Design Docs)_
- **Link:** _URL to the canonical reference (e.g., <https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/creating-an-agent>)_
- **Pledge:** _I will not consult other sources during this module unless explicitly assigned._

Write this declaration at the top of your workspace and refer back to it whenever you feel the temptation to jump to other references. This commitment reinforces disciplined learning and reduces cognitive overload.
