# Coursera Course Designer Demo Script
## "Agentcraft Orientation: Professional Agent Development"

### Demo Overview (3-5 minutes)
**Objective:** Demonstrate instructional design principles and course architecture skills

---

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"Hi, I'm Corey, and I'd like to show you how I approach course design by walking through 'Agentcraft Orientation' - a comprehensive curriculum that transforms developers from 'prompt-and-pray' beginners into professional agent builders through structured, constraint-based learning."

### Course Architecture Demonstration (2 minutes)

**1. Learning Scaffold Design**
- **Module 1 - Sequester Contract:** Establishes discipline through Single Source of Truth
- **Module 2 - Mental Models:** Builds conceptual frameworks (Chatbot ≠ Agent, Teacher-Student metaphor)
- **Module 3 - Professional Standards:** Introduces Spec-Test-Trace-Guardrail methodology  
- **Module 4 - Deterministic Evals:** Teaches reliability through golden tests and reproducibility
- **Module 5 - Design→Build→Run:** Provides systematic development workflow

**2. Instructional Design Principles**
- **Constraint-Based Learning:** "One Source. One System. One Notebook" reduces cognitive overload
- **Memorable Mantras:** Each module ends with actionable principles ("Trust What You Can Re-run")
- **Hands-on Application:** SST declarations, golden test creation, professional checklists
- **Progressive Complexity:** From mindset→models→standards→evaluation→workflow

**3. Learning Experience Design**
- Clean, distraction-free interface with downloadable resources
- Detailed slide scripts for consistent delivery (25 pages of presenter notes)
- Practical templates and starter files for immediate application

### Key Teaching Moments (1.5 minutes)

**Module 1 - Sequester Contract Demo:**
- Show SST Declaration Template in action
- Explain pedagogical reasoning: "Too Many Sources = No Signal"
- Demonstrate structured workspace setup

**Module 3 - Professional Standards:**
- Highlight "Professional vs Enterprise" distinction
- Show the four pillars framework: Spec-Test-Trace-Guardrail
- Walk through agent evaluation checklist

**Module 4 - Deterministic Evals:**
- Demo the "Failing Golden → Fix → Re-run" cycle
- Show GoldenTests_Starter.yaml practical examples

### Course Design Philosophy (1 minute)
"This curriculum demonstrates advanced instructional design through:
1. **Constraint-driven pedagogy** - Strategic limitation amplifies learning depth
2. **Cognitive load management** - Each module builds one core mental model
3. **Transfer-focused outcomes** - Every lesson produces immediately applicable skills
4. **Assessment integration** - Golden tests and checklists provide continuous feedback"

### Call to Action (30 seconds)
"This represents my approach to transforming complex technical domains into structured, memorable learning experiences. The detailed presenter scripts, practical templates, and progressive skill-building demonstrate the systematic instructional design thinking I'd bring to Coursera's course development."
